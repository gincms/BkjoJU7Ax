<h1>Gutting Wordpress</h1>

<section class="content-body">
<p>It might seem strange to create a blog about a platform I detest; I spend enough time with WordPress in my day job, committing my spare time to it could be considered masochistic. Indeed, I’d rather be using <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>.</p>
<p>However, my time with WordPress has forced me to go burrowing through the source code to solve less common problems. I’m hoping I can offer something that might save someone else some time and hair-loss. Also, I thought it might be somewhat cathartic to experiment with different ways of making WordPress less of a bitch to work with. In some cases it means using WordPress features in a smarter way, in others, it means by-passing the WordPress way completely. I prefer the latter. It feels like a chance at a fresh start. In reality, though, it’s just an opportunity to hack. And who doesn’t love a good bit of hacking? I can’t promise that what you’ll see here will be pretty, but it’ll probably be interesting, and might even be useful. Especially if you’re developing on Wordpress.</p>
