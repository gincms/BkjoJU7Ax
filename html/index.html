      <p>I guess I finally snapped.</p>
<p>Moving from one bloated CMS to another, I finally decided to walk away from it. I wanted to relieve myself of the stress. I grew weary of constantly battling the tools that had been created with (what I hope was) the intention of making things easier. It&#39;s common for projects to mutate over time, though, growing from purring kittens into wild, monolithic beasts. But <a href="/code-has-consequences/">the last one</a>... That was the worst.</p>
<p>So, now, I&#39;m trying something new: I&#39;m building a lightweight CMS <em>from scratch</em>. Not only that, but I&#39;m going to do something I&#39;ve not done before with a personal project: I&#39;m going to let you see the work-in-progress. In fact, that&#39;s why this site looks as it does right now. I&#39;ve been focusing on creating the admin area of the CMS. Now, I&#39;ve got it to a point where I can actually use it to create content and publish it. But because my focus as been on the admin area, I&#39;ve not yet spent much time on the public site layout. Hence, <em>this</em>.</p>
<p>But, it&#39;s OK, though. Because, back when this site was still <a href="/gutting-wordpress/">Death by Wordpress</a>, it was my intention to start with a fairly blank canvas and build it out publicly. A year and a half later, I&#39;m finally doing that. But it&#39;s no longer in Wordpress. It&#39;s in <strong>Gin</strong>.</p>
<p>More to follow. Soon... For now, here some recent posts.</p>
