      &lt;p&gt;I guess I finally snapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving from one bloated CMS to another, I finally decided to walk away from it. I wanted to relieve myself of the stress. I grew weary of constantly battling the tools that had been created with (what I hope was) the intention of making things easier. It&amp;#39;s common for projects to mutate over time, though, growing from purring kittens into wild, monolithic beasts. But &lt;a href=&quot;/code-has-consequences/&quot;&gt;the last one&lt;/a&gt;... That was the worst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, now, I&amp;#39;m trying something new: I&amp;#39;m building a lightweight CMS &lt;em&gt;from scratch&lt;/em&gt;. Not only that, but I&amp;#39;m going to do something I&amp;#39;ve not done before with a personal project: I&amp;#39;m going to let you see the work-in-progress. In fact, that&amp;#39;s why this site looks as it does right now. I&amp;#39;ve been focusing on creating the admin area of the CMS. Now, I&amp;#39;ve got it to a point where I can actually use it to create content and publish it. But because my focus as been on the admin area, I&amp;#39;ve not yet spent much time on the public site layout. Hence, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, it&amp;#39;s OK, though. Because, back when this site was still &lt;a href=&quot;/gutting-wordpress/&quot;&gt;Death by Wordpress&lt;/a&gt;, it was my intention to start with a fairly blank canvas and build it out publicly. A year and a half later, I&amp;#39;m finally doing that. But it&amp;#39;s no longer in Wordpress. It&amp;#39;s in &lt;strong&gt;Gin&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More to follow. Soon... For now, here some recent posts.&lt;/p&gt;
