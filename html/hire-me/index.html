Ultimately, it&#39;s where our values meet and overlap that&#39;s going to determine whether or not we&#39;re a good fit for each other. What someone does can change pretty quickly, but who they are typically can&#39;t. So, let me tell you who I am.</p> <h3 id="in-general">In general</h3> <p>I&#39;m an autodidact: there&#39;s nothing I&#39;ve needed to learn that I&#39;ve not been able to teach myself, though, through trial and error, I&#39;ve also learned when to ask for help. I listen more than I speak, and when I speak I try to make sure that what I say is worth hearing. I&#39;m honest, sometimes brutally; I can&#39;t turn this off because when I lie it feels like I&#39;m being torn in two.</p> <p>I have obsessive-compulsive tendencies; the compulsive part is mostly controlled but the obsession is not, which, though it has its drawbacks, means I&#39;m dedicated to delivering.</p> <p>I&#39;m aware of my limitations, but not all of them, and I&#39;m grateful when the ones I don&#39;t perceive are revealed to me. I have a curious, playful and mischievous mind that gets restless, which is why <strong>I&#39;m a full-stack developer</strong>: the variety keeps me interested.</p> <h3 id="in-development">In development</h3> <p>I&#39;m not a &quot;10x&quot; developer, but I&#39;m a capable one. I try to write code that is easy to understand and design applications that are easy to use. I find repetition boring, so I try to eliminate it through automation wherever possible; I care about people&#39;s time so I also try to eliminate other mundane tasks by the same means.</p> <p>I work best with people who care about both what they&#39;re building and the people who are going to use it. I don&#39;t always document as I go, but I care about the people who will inherit my work, so I do my best to make sure documentation gets written; experience has shown me the misery one&#39;s life can become when adequate documentation isn&#39;t provided. Also, <em>sometimes</em> I actually find documenting quite therapeutic.</p> <p>I&#39;ve spent thousands of hours of my life coding and, although I enjoy it, I don&#39;t want to do it forever. My favourite thing about development is the outcome. Development is a process and coding a means to an end. I care about fulfilling a single purpose: bring ideas into reality.</p> <p>If I sound like the type of person you&#39;d like to work with, please get in touch via <a href="https://twitter.com/LatnBlack">twitter</a>.</p> </section> </article> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> </article> <footer class="footer has-text-centered"> <ul class="gin-navigation"> <li> <a href="https://twitter.com/LatnBlack" title="Twitter" class="gin-navigation__link"> Twitter </a></li> <li> <a href="https://latnblack.com" title="me.com" class="gin-navigation__link"> me.com </a></li> </ul> </footer> <!-- Gin foot --> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/15.6.1/react.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/15.6.1/react-dom.min.js"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
