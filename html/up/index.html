<p>I tend to eliminate repetitive tasks at the earliest possible opportunity. It&#39;s partly because I&#39;m lazy, but mostly because I don&#39;t like wasting time or energy. In other words, I appreciate efficiency.</p>
<p>When on the command line I&#39;m frequent moving between directories, often going several levels deep before having to resurface to move into another. Far too often this means I end up having to type:</p>
<pre><code>cd ../../../../
</code></pre><p>The solution was to write a small bash function in my _~/.bash_profile_. This is it:</p>
<pre><code>function up {

  cwd=$(pwd);
  cds=&quot;&quot;;
  i=0;

  if [ $1 ] &amp;&amp; [ $1 -gt 0 ]
  then

    i=$1

    # Add the levels to the string
    while [ &quot;$i&quot; -ne &quot;0&quot; ]; do
      cds=&quot;$cds../&quot;;
      i=$(expr $i - 1);
    done

    # Excute the command
    cd &quot;$cds&quot;
  else                                                                          
    cd ../
  fi

}
</code></pre><p>Now, instead of a <code>cd</code> plus multiple <code>../</code>, I can just type:</p>
<pre><code>up 4
</code></pre><p>It was easier to write the function than find a script that already did the same thing. Feel free to use it.</p>
