      &lt;p&gt;One of the things I hate about WordPress is that there’s no in-built way to handle redirects. Earlier this year, after discovering that my colleagues were replacing entire sections of the site in an extremely naive and dangerous way, I decided we needed a tool to make the process more sensible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;nuts-and-bolts&quot;&gt;Nuts and Bolts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t matter, but this is &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt;: periodically, sections of the site had to be updated — not just content, but frequently titles and slugs. Sometimes pages and even subsections were removed completely.You know what that means, right? 404s all over the place. Unfortunately, no one who understood the risks had any idea they were doing this type of…thing?&lt;/p&gt;
