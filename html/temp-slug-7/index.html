      <p>One of the things I hate about WordPress is that there’s no in-built way to handle redirects. Earlier this year, after discovering that my colleagues were replacing entire sections of the site in an extremely naive and dangerous way, I decided we needed a tool to make the process more sensible.</p>

<p>The <em>why</em> doesn’t matter, but this is <em>what</em>: periodically, sections of the site had to be updated — not just content, but frequently titles and slugs. Sometimes pages and even subsections were removed completely.You know what that means, right? 404s all over the place.
