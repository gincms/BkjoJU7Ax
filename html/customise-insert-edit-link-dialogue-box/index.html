      <p>Recently, I had to create an easy way to select a custom post type (CPT) and insert it into a different CPT’s edit page. I’ve done this this type of thing before but, the last time I did, I took the approach of creating a replicable autocomplete field (allowing the user to add as many items as they want). Autocomplete made sense in this case because, overall, I think it made the post selection process faster. Implementation, however, was relatively slow. Why? Because I had to create:</p>
<ul>
<li>the autocomplete input field</li>
<li>the logic that handled replication</li>
<li>the logic that managed the autocomplete behaviour (yes, it was necessary)</li>
<li>the input sanitisation logic</li>
<li>the AJAX request</li>
<li>a <em>wp<em>ajax</em></em> function to handle the ajax request</li>
<li>the code that would render the response</li>
<li>the code that would parse the AJAX response, as well as update some page elements</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these steps were particularly difficult, and I could quite easily replicate them, but the approach felt like overkill this time round. Users just needed to be able to select a single instance of <em>one</em> CPT, very much like when adding a link to a post. This got me thinking and lead me to investigate using WordPress’s existing <em>Insert/Edit Link</em> modal that’s available via the visual editor.</p>
<h3 id="a-little-less-work">A little less work</h3>
<p>Making the Insert/Edit Link modal window available outside of the visual editor was simple: hook into the <code>admin_enqueue_scripts</code> and enqueue the <code>wp-link</code> script for the required page:</p>
<pre><code>function my_funky_func() {
    wp_enqueue_script(&#39;wp-link&#39;);
}
add_action(&#39;admin_enqueue_scripts&#39;, &#39;my_funky_func&#39;);
</code></pre><p>In the JS for the edit page, <code>wpLink.open()</code> must triggered by a click event and handled:</p>
<pre><code>    $(&#39;body&#39;).on(&#39;click&#39;, &#39;#my-modal-trigger&#39;, function(e) {

        // This can be any value. Its sole purpose is to let us know if the modal that&#39;s open
        // is the default or a custom one.
        window.mySpecialModalVariable = e.target.dataset.target;

        // This must have a value because the link dialogue expects it to 
        // (a wp_editor instance, actually, but that part doesn&#39;t matter here...as long as it has a value).
        wpActiveEditor = true;

        // Open the link popup.
        wpLink.open();

        // So no other action is triggered.
        return false;
    });
</code></pre><p>The submission and cancellation of the Insert/Edit Link dialogue box also needs to be handled. So off we go…</p>
<pre><code>    function closeMyModal() {

        // Again, an editor instance is expected, as upon closing .focus() is called on
        // wpLink.textarea, so we need to provide a jQuery object to .focus() on.
        wpLink.textarea = $(&#39;body&#39;);
        wpLink.close();

        window.mySpecialModalVariable = false;
        e.preventDefault ? e.preventDefault() : e.returnValue = false;
        e.stopPropagation();
    };

    // When the dialogue box&#39;s submit button is clicked...
    $(&#39;body&#39;).on(&#39;click&#39;, &#39;#wp-link-submit&#39;, function(e) {

        var selectedItem = wpLink.getAttrs();

        if (!selectedItem.href) {
            closeMyModal();
        }

        // Do something with the selectedItem, then close the dialogue box.

       closeMyModal();
    });

    // When the user clicks the cancel button, close button, or overlay...
    $(&#39;body&#39;).on(&#39;click&#39;, &#39;#wp-link-cancel, #wp-link-close, #wp-link-backdrop&#39;, function(e) {

        // Do whatever&#39;s necessary, then...

        closeMyModal();
    });
</code></pre><h3 id="good-but-not-good-enough-">Good, but not good enough…</h3>
<p>The above works. Great. The problem with it is that it allows you to select <em>any</em> post type. You might want this. I didn’t. So I needed to modify the AJAX call and/or the query that returns the results.</p>
<p>It turns out that it’s relatively simple (but not totally obvious how) to manipulate the Insert/Edit modal’s content: <em>intercept the AJAX request</em>.</p>
<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {

    $.ajaxSetup({
        beforeSend: function(jqXHR, data) {

            // I don&#39;t want to do anything if there&#39;s no data to send.
            if (!data.data) return true;

            // I only want to modify the request if it&#39;s for my custom modal. 
            if (!window.mySpecialModalVariable) return true;

            // Made it. Now, I need to know where the AJAX is going.
            // Break down the query params into key/value pairs and find out.
            $.each(data.data.split(&#39;&amp;&#39;), function(i, kv) {
                var kv = kv.split(&#39;=&#39;);
                if (kv[0] == &#39;action&#39; &amp;&amp; kv[1] == &#39;wp-link-ajax&#39;) {
                    data.data += &#39;&amp;my-special-param=1&#39;;
                }
            });

            return true;
        }
    });
});
</code></pre><p>Looking good so far. You may have noticed the <code>window.mySpecialModalVariable</code> in the code above. This exists for the purpose of letting us know if the AJAX request is coming from a custom modal or the default one. It’s given a value when the custom modal is opened, and it’s set to false when the dialogue box is closed via a call to <code>closeMyModal()</code>.</p>
<p>Having this variable isn’t imperative, but if you (might ever) have a visual editor on the same page in which this code will run, you’d find that <em>all</em> AJAX requests to <code>wp-link-ajax</code> would be modified, and the selection of posts in regular Insert/Edit Link modals would be limited to the same ones in your custom modal.</p>
<h3 id="and-finally-">And finally…</h3>
<p>All that remains is to filter <code>wp_link_query_args</code> and check for <code>my-special-param</code>‘s presence.</p>
<pre><code>function awesome_wp_link_filter($args) {
    global $post;

    if (array_key_exists(&#39;my-special-param&#39;, $_POST)) {
        $args[&#39;post_type&#39;] = array(&#39;my-special-post-type&#39;);
    }

    return $args;
}

add_filter(&#39;wp_link_query_args&#39;, &#39;awesome_wp_link_filter&#39;, 99);
</code></pre><p>And that’s it. When the custom modal is launched, it will only display a list of <code>my-special-post-type</code>s. It might not seem like a big deal, but when you’ve got 100,000+ rows in <code>wp_posts</code>, 20+ different post types, and there are only 50 posts of the CPT you’re after, it’s nice to be able to select from a subset rather than the whole set.</p>
