  "body": "Back in February of 2017, several months after my [near-catastrophic error](/gincms/cms-stress/ \"CMS Stress\"), I attended a Hacks/Hackers event in London. That evening I heard Matt Kiser, the founder of [WTFJHT \"WhatTheFuckJustHappenedToday\"](1), speaking about the creation of his site, the tools and services he uses, and how he made the collaborative/community aspect of the site work. In the process, he inadvertently vindicated an idea that had been tumbling around in my mind for some time: code and content can (and maybe should) share the same workflow.\r\n\r\n### A repurposed workflow\r\n\r\nMatt explained that WTFJHT is built using [Jekyll](2), a static site generator. All the content is in plain files (written in Markdown); there is no database. The site also has a public GitHub repository that anyone can fork and modify in order to contribute to the site. Changes are submitted via pull-requests, meaning they must be reviewed before they are applyed and deployed. This is a familiar process for developers, but it's being used as an *editorial* workflow.\r\n\r\n### Teamwork\r\n\r\nAs I've worked in a couple of large publishers, I've had the opportunity to observe both the development and editorial workflow. What I've come see is that they very simliar.\r\n\r\nPeople are usually working on different parts of the product, so an individual team member's work usually won't have an impact on another's. But even when there is overlap, regular updates and communication among team members can mitigate any major conflicts. Finally, it might also be the case—depending on the team and structure—that a senior member is responsible for some form of quality control before work is published/deployed.\r\n\r\nThe above is fairly typical. Yet, in practice, there are fundamental differences between development and content teams when it comes to how the workflow manifests, and I think it mainly comes down to the tools that are available.\r\n\r\n### Traditional tools\r\n\r\nSpeak to pretty much any developer, even the least experienced, and they've almost certainly heard of version control. I've never come across a developer that *doesn't* know what a VCS is (although I'm sure there's one out there somewhere, just as there are those who flat out *refuse* to adopt any form of version control. Yes, they exist too). In contrast, I've found that the typical content creator has a very limited—if any—idea of version control. At best, they have a concept of *history* or *versions*, as found in software like Wordpress, Microsoft Word, or Google Docs, if they're so savvy.\r\n\r\n### Undervalued\r\n\r\nIt's not difficult to understand why the average content creator has no idea about version control. In development it's standard practice to use a VCS of some kind: it protects both the temporal and monetary investment, as developers (and, therefore, their work) can be very expensive. Imagine all that hard work was suddenly erased because somebody accidentally [deleted the wrong directory](/gincms/cms-stress/ \"CMS Stress\")...\r\n\r\nBut what about the value of the content and those who write it? It should be plain as day. Websites and applications alike are dependent, to varying degress, on their content, *not just code*. Blog posts, marketing material, documentation, and general information all play vital roles, and yet the content often lacks the same level of protection as code. The content is undervalued, possibly because its writers are too.\r\n\r\n### Out of control\r\n\r\nOf course, the role of content varies, depending on where and how it's being used, and that affects its value. But isn't this also true of code? Yet even the most trivial feature, plugin, addon or script is likely to be placed under version control by any reasonable developer. Often one of the first thoughts for a developer when creating a new codebase: create a repository, get it under version control. In the world of content creation, however, version control is, at best, an afterthought and, at worst, it's relegated to oblivion by ignorance. Naturally, the risk doesn't become apparent until things go wrong.\r\n\r\n[1]:http://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com\r\n[2]:https://jekyllrb.com/",
