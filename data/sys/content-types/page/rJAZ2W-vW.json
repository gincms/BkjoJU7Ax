Actually, I started looking at and working on it about three months ago, but then stopped all work on Gin—and coding in general—for reasons I won't go into just now. When I got back to the changes I'd started but abandoned, I continued the implementation but quickly realised it was over-engineered.\r\n\r\n### Over-engineering\r\n\r\nIn Gin, as in many a CMS, there's the concept of *content types*. Up until now, on Prickly Dev, I've only been using one: the humble *page*. My plan was to alter the application to support two new content types: navigation and navigation-item. I thought it would make sense because they would have their own properties, so it seems logical to normalise them. They would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   \"name\": \"nav\",\r\n\t \"label\": \"Nav\",\r\n\t \"fields\": {\r\n\t\t \"nav-item\": {\r\n\t\t\t \"type\": \"content-type\",\r\n\t\t\t \"name: \"nav-item\",\r\n\t\t\t ...\r\n\t\t }\r\n\t }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI was trying to build out the navigation. Initial, when designing the content types I had wanted to keep them flat, but later decided it would be useful to be able reference a content-type from another content-type. Something like:\r\n\r\n*(Insert code sample here)*\r\n\r\nThis would allow the user creating a content type of, say",
