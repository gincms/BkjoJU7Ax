  "body": "A recent addition to Gin is the ability to create custom menus. This was a feature desired from the outset, but not as high a priority as keeping *everything* versioned and being able to create simple posts and pages.\r\n\r\nI actually started looking at and working on the feature about three months ago, but then stopped all work on Gin for reasons I won't go into just now. Coming back to the work I'd started, I decided to go with simpler approach that I think works well and significantly simplifies both implementation and usage. Using the footer menu of this site as the basis of the example, I'll start show how explain how we get achieve the desired output.\r\n\r\n### The generated HTML\r\n\r\n{{embed type=code slug=footer-menu-html fields=title,code}}\r\n\r\n### Creating  a menu\r\n\r\n*(insert markdown menu snippet here)*\r\n\r\nThe above will result in the following markup:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What's happening under the hood\r\n\r\n#### Foundation\r\nThe nav is just a system content type, like the *page* content type that is used to write posts like the one you're reading. You could just create the equivalent using Gin's custom content type support. But, there's more. It has a textarea field that expects Markdown. You use this to design your menu. \r\n\r\n#### Rendering your nav\r\nOnce you have your nav, it can be used in a one of two ways:\r\n\r\nIt can be embedded in content using the `{{tag type=nav, limit=1}}` helper tag (known as *Elements* in Gin), or you can output it in a template, like so: `{{ nav(\"my-nav\") }}`. \r\n\r\n ",
