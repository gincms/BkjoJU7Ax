Did I make a copy of the content directory as recommended? *No*. Why would I? I've performed hundreds—if not *thousands*—of similar operations and not lost anything. Until *now*. \r\n\r\nOK, what else? *Think*. Cron job: automated backups of the DB. *Crap*. I didn't get around to setting that up. I was more concerned with the code. OK. How do you recover files deleted with `rm`? Maybe if that sector of the disk hasn't been overwritten, I can recover the directory I deleted...\r\n\r\n### Oh my word!\r\n\r\nIn December of 2015 I had an idea for tool to help me remember my favourite words. I knocked together a Chrome extension in an afternoon and was pleased with the return on investment. It was basic, but effective. About a month later, the extension supported multiple users and had an accompanying mobile app and a [website](https://ohmyword.xyz).\r\n\r\nThe main site was actually a purpose-built Node application, and the [blog](https://ohmyword.xyz) was powered by Ghost.",
