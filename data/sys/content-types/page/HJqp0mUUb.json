  "body": "I'm not going to describe what I do, because it varies greatly. I do what's necessary. I learn and apply, so what I do and how I do it changes with the knowledge and experience I gain, which is also varied. So, instead of telling you what I do, I'll tell you who I am.\r\n\r\n### In general\r\n\r\nI'm an autodidact: there's nothing I've needed to learn that I've not been able to learn by myself. I listen more than I speak, and when I speak I try to make sure that what I say is worth hearing. I'm honest, sometimes too brutally; I can't turn this off because when I lie it feels like I'm being torn in two. I have obsessive-compulsive tendencies; the compulsive part is mostly controlled but the obsession is not, which, though it has its downsides, means I'm dedicated to delivering. I'm aware of my limitations, but not all of them, and I'm grateful when the ones I haven't perceived are revealed to me. I have a curious, playful and mischievous mind that gets restless, which is why I'm a full-stack developer: the variety keeps me interested. My mind is also messy, but I think I do a good job of shielding people from exposure to its messiness by thinking carefully about what I say and doâ€”but I'm not always successful.\r\n\r\n### In development\r\n\r\nI'm not a \"10x\" developer, but I think I'm a capable one. I try to write code that is easy to understand and design applications that are easy to use. I find repetition boring, so I try to eliminate it through automation wherever possible; I care about people's time so I also try to eliminate other mundane tasks by the same means. I work best with people who care about both what they're building and the people who are going to use it. I don't always document as I go, but I care about the people who will inherit my work, so I do my best to make sure documentation gets written; experience has shown me the misery one's development life can become when adequate documentation isn't provided. Also, *sometimes* I actually find documenting quite therapeutic. I've spent thousands of hours of my life coding and, although I enjoy it, I don't want to do it forever. My favourite thing about development is the outcome. Development is a process and coding a means to an end. I care about fulfilling a single purpose: bring an idea into reality.\r\n\r\nIf I sound like the type of person you'd like to work with, please get in touch via [twitter](https://twitter.com/LatnBlack).",
