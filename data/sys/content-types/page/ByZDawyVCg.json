  "body": "\n### The symptom\n\nI tried to delete Hello Dolly and WordPress asked me for FTP credentials to perform the action.\n\n### The cause(s)\n\n#### Directory permissions/ownership\n\nThe WordPress directory wasn’t owned by Nginx. I fixed that quickly by `cd`ing into the directory of my WordPress installation and doing:\n\n```\nchown -R nginx:nginx . \n```\n\n#### Process ownership\n\nThe above didn’t resolve it though. As it happens PHP was running under a different user that didn’t have permission to access the files directly. In my case, `php-fpm` was running under `apache`, which it seems is the default configuration upon installation. I edited `/etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf` and changed:\n\n```\n; RPM: apache Choosed to be able to access some dir as httpd\nuser = apache\n\n; RPM: Keep a group allowed to write in log dir.\ngroup = apache\n```\n\nTo this:\n\n```\n; RPM: apache Choosed to be able to access some dir as httpd\nuser = nginx\n\n; RPM: Keep a group allowed to write in log dir.\ngroup = nginx\n```\n\nThen restarted `php-fpm`:\n\n```\nsudo service php-fpm restart`\n```\n\nAll sorted. No more request for FTP credentials. Now I can get on with more interesting things, like installing and playing with the [JSON API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-api/) plugin.\n\n\n",
